### Hi there 👋
I'm a junior software developer and University of Newcastle Australia Alumni. 
I am highly focused on the c# and .net eco-system.

I'm currently working on:
- 🐛 Bugger! A bug tracking app for learning Blazor Server and tracking my own bugs (look out Jira!)
- 💬 Blogger! To keep track and share my projects to the world
- 🖥️ Homelab Construction - self-hosting services and learning enterprise networking/devops
