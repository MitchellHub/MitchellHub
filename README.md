### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an I.T undergraduate in their final semester of study at Newcastle University, looking to start a career in software development. I love the c# and .net eco-system, having built my own full-stack asp.net web app. I believe that I have coding fundamentals down pat and am now moving onto better coding principles, architecture and DevOps concepts - but I still have a long way to go. 

I'm currently working on
- Consuming Api's and Api best practices
- Blazor development 
- Xamarin mobile app development
