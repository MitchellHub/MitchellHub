### Hi there 👋
I'm a junior software engineer and University of Newcastle AUS Alumni. I love the c# and .net eco-system - Blazor is the future!

I'm currently working on:
- 🐛 Bugger! A bug tracking app for learning Blazor Server and tracking my owns bugs (look out Jira!)
- 🔥 .net core development
- 📱 Xamarin mobile app development
